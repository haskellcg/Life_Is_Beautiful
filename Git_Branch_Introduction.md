# Git Branch
  Nearly every VCS has some form of branching support. Branching means you diverge from the main line of development and continue to do work without messing with that main line. **_In many VCS tools, this is a somewhat expensive process, often requiring you to create a new copy of your source code directory, which can take a long time for large project_**.
  
  The way Git braches is incredibly lightweight, making branching operations nearly instantaneous, and swiching back and forth between branches generally just as fast.
